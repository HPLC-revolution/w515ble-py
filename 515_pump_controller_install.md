14. The purchased controller includes a **DC-DC converter** that connects to the red/black wires going to the pump housing cooling fan.
15. Cut the cooling fan wires at a point where the **three red wires** (one to fan, one from original Waters board, one to new controller board) can be soldered together.
16. Repeat for the **three black wires**. Refer to the image below:
    ![Step 16](https://github.com/HPLC-revolution/w515ble-py/raw/main/images/install-12.jpg)
17. Confirm the power connection by turning on the pump. Ensure the fan runs, and the blue LED on the power module lights up as shown:
    ![Step 17](https://github.com/HPLC-revolution/w515ble-py/raw/main/images/install-10.jpg)
18. The **controller module** should blink blue while waiting for a BLE connection. It will blink green when successfully connected to your laptop via Bluetooth.
19. Power down the pump and proceed.
20. Remove the **two-sided tape cover** from the bottom of the main power/controller board, then stick it to the base of the pump housing as shown:
    ![Step 20](https://github.com/HPLC-revolution/w515ble-py/raw/main/images/install-13.jpg)
21. Power on the pump and confirm the **membrane buttons** on the pump face operate correctly.
22. Power down the pump and install the cover.
